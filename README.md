 CRUD TODO APP W. REACTJS 

# Todo App

## Overview:
This is a simple Todo App built using React. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, updating, and deleting items from the list. The project uses modern JavaScript (ES2020), React hooks, and includes an ESLint configuration for maintaining code quality.

## Features:
- Add new tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Fully responsive design.
  
## Files:
1. **index.html**: Provides the basic HTML structure to render the React app.
2. **main.jsx**: The entry point for the React application.
3. **eslint.config.js**: ESLint configuration for code quality and linting rules.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Font Awesome**: For adding icons to the UI.
- **Google Fonts**: Used for custom typography.

## How to Run the Project:
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

## ESLint Configuration:
The project uses ESLint with the following plugins:
- **React**: Linting rules for React applications.
- **React Hooks**: Ensures correct usage of React hooks.
- **React Refresh**: Improves the developer experience with hot reloading.

### Key ESLint Rules:
- Follows recommended rules for both JavaScript and React.
- Disabled `react/jsx-no-target-blank` to allow links to open in new tabs without warnings.
- Enabled `react-refresh/only-export-components` to optimize component exports.

## Notes:
- You can modify the `main.jsx` file to add new features or customize the design.
- Ensure you run `npm run lint` to check for any code issues as you develop the app.
